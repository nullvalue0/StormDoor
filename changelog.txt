StormDoor Changelog
===================

v0.3.2 beta - 10/21/2004
------------------------
* Officially added the UserInput event. This should be used to hand all client 
  input instead of the WaitForKey function.. This way the processor will not 
  peg out at 100% while waiting for input. Understanding and use of a state 
  machine will be neccessary when using this approach.

* The StormDoor control now shows current user statistics, such as time 
  remaining, alias, and security level.

* Got rid of the annoying "Unrecognized Command" popup message.

* Fixed a spelling error in the foreground color selections.

* Added some more sample code applications.

* You can now pass just the socket handle instead of a path to the dropfile 
  by using the -H switch on the OpenDropFile command.


v0.3.1 beta - 07/14/2004

  terminal)
